<objective>
Verify complete KMP setup by running both apps and confirming cross-platform functionality.

Purpose: Final validation that the foundation phase is complete - both native apps run and successfully consume shared Kotlin code. This checkpoint ensures we don't proceed with a broken foundation.

Output: Confirmation that both iOS and Android apps display platform-specific greetings from shared code.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run all Gradle checks and document project structure</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Execute comprehensive project validation:

1. Run full project build:
   - `./gradlew build`
   - Captures any remaining configuration issues

2. Document the final project structure:
   - List all modules and their purpose
   - Note key Gradle tasks for each target
   - Record version information (Kotlin, Gradle, Compose, iOS deployment target)

3. Create a quick-reference for common commands:
   - Android: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug`
   - iOS framework: `./gradlew :shared:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64`
   - Clean: `./gradlew clean`

4. Verify no warnings or deprecations in build output that would cause issues later.

  <what-built>Complete KMP project with Android app (Jetpack Compose) and iOS app (SwiftUI) both consuming shared Kotlin code</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Android: Run `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug` with an emulator/device connected
       - OR open androidApp in Android Studio and run on emulator
       - App should display: "Hello from Android [SDK version]!"

    2. iOS: Open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj in Xcode
       - Select iPhone 15 simulator (or any iOS 16+ simulator)
       - Build and run (Cmd+R)
       - App should display: "Hello from iOS [version]!"

    3. Confirm both apps:
       - Launch without crashes
       - Display the greeting text from shared module
       - Demonstrate the platform-specific message (Android shows SDK number, iOS shows version)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if both apps run and show platform greetings, or describe any issues encountered</resume-signal>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `./gradlew build` succeeds
- [ ] Android app installs and runs on emulator/device
- [ ] iOS app builds and runs on simulator
- [ ] Both apps display platform-specific greeting from shared code
- [ ] User has verified the apps visually
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All tasks completed
- User has visually verified both apps running
- Cross-platform architecture proven working
- Foundation phase ready for Phase 2 (Book Data Layer)
